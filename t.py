Here is the combined code:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
import os
import time
import io

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/file-timestamps")
async def file_timestamps(file: UploadFile = File(...)):
    try:
        contents = await file.read()
        temp_file = io.BytesIO(contents)

        # Create a temporary file to get timestamps
        with open("temp_file", "wb") as f:
            f.write(temp_file.getbuffer())

        # Get creation and modification timestamps
        ti_c = os.path.getctime("temp_file")
        ti_m = os.path.getmtime("temp_file")

        # Convert the time in seconds to a timestamp
        c_ti = time.ctime(ti_c)
        m_ti = time.ctime(ti_m)

        # Clean up the temporary file
        os.remove("temp_file")

        return JSONResponse(content={
            "Created At": c_ti,
            "Last Modified At": m_ti
        })

    except Exception as e:
        return JSONResponse(content={"Error": str(e)}, status_code=500)
```

This combined code includes the original file handling and timestamp retrieval logic along with the FastAPI framework for handling file uploads and returning the file timestamps as a JSON response.
